Enlightenment-Themes
====================

Various Enlightenment and Terminology themes i'm working on, a branch per theme, development status for each theme is listed below.

For released themes you can simply download the bundled tarball extract it with `tar -xf <ThemeName>-bundle.tar.xf` and then run `install.sh` to put the files
in the appropriate spot in your home directory.

Building a theme is as simple as running the `./build-darkmod.sh` script. The built theme should be automatically put in your theme directory.

If you would like to modify one of the themes or create a new theme with vtx or darkmod take a look at [Hacking.md](Hacking.md)
