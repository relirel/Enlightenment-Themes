This is a donationware font which really means it's 100% free. Yes, you read that correctly. Feel free to use this on any commercial or non-commercial projects. I don't charge any fee for the usage of this, I'm just glad it's being used so widely. But if you feel like the font has helped you a lot and feel like giving back a little then feel free to donate any amount you see fit, it's completely optional but greatly appreciated.

If you do use this however, please show me the work you used it on (my e-mail's on my profile page)
